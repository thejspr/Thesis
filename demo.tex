For ease of use, Yarn exposes a help command to show the options available
when launching the server. Figure~\ref{screenshot} shows the output of the
help command.

Yarn can easily be installed using RubyGems which is included in Ruby as of
version 1.9. To install Yarn run the following command \texttt{gem install
  yarn}, and now Yarn is available from the command-line.
