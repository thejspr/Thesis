In this project, a concurrent webserver is implemented in Ruby using the
Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) method. 

Topics relevant to the thesis, namely Ruby webservers, concurrent programming, the
Ruby programming language and BDD are covered. The implementation of each
requirement is described, along with selected technical problems and their
solutions.

Yarn, the name of the implemented webserver, is benchmarked to other Ruby
webservers and the results revealed that for static requests it performed subpar, but for CPU intensive applications it performed well.

Using Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) enabled getting started on the
implementation right away, without having to produce a big design upfront.
This proved to be both an advantage and a disadvantage, as some design
decisions which turned out not to work as expected, might have been avoided.
As BDD employs a test-first approach, a large test-suite was produced and
this enabled design changes late in the development, without
having to worry about the correctness of the implementation.
