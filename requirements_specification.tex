\section{Requirements Specification}
In order to have a clear goal of what the software produced in this project
should do, a set of requirements are essential. The following lists the
requirements for the software developed in this project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Handle a high volume of concurrent requests.
  \item Implement the Rack interface.
  \item Logging of requests and responses.
\end{itemize}

As this project was developed using BDD, the requirements specification was
translated into a set of acceptance tests to get concrete feedback on
completed requirements. The acceptance tests are included as
Appendix~\ref{acceptance_tests}.
