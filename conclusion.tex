% What the thesis sai

BDD works well, but can be hard with new technology. As a design flaws are
detected which might have been prevented with a more thorough design upfront.

For most applications, processor power is not an issue. Whats more important
are disk and network IO.

\section{Future Work}
% \meta{Covers which what could be improved if more time was available}
Given more time for development, there are a number of imminent features and
bugs which should be added or fixed before Yarn will be stable enough to be
used in a production environment.

%opensource.
The source-code for Yarn is open-source and publicly available on Github which
is a web-based collaborative Git hosting site. This enables anyone to suggest
or add improvements and features to the project for the good of all Yarn
users.

%Support keep-alive connections to save TCP overhead.
Yarn currently does not support persistent TCP connections, and for each
request, a new TCP connection is used. This creates an overhead which could be
spared by allowing clients to reuse existing connections.
