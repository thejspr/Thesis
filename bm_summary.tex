\section{Summary}
In this chapter, the usage, installation and distribution of Yarn was covered.
Yarn was also benchmarked in terms of how many requests per second it could
serve. The results were compared to other Ruby webservers, and whilst yarn
performed well for CPU intensive requests, it left room for improvement when
serving static content. In the next chapter Yarn and the process of using BDD
is evaluated.
