% \meta{I choose to put implementation and testing together as that suits the
%   development method well. The chapter will contain interesting parts of the
%     implementation, problems which arose along the way and how I solved them.
% There is a section fore each of the requirements.}

The development of each requirement was driven by
aiming to satisfy an acceptance test which stated the intended behavior of the feature.
The acceptance tests were written in a natural language using Cucumber, and
once the acceptance test passed the feature was considered done. All
requirements were satisfied, and this chapter covers some of the problems, and
their solutions, that occured during the eight weeks of development.

Initially, an overview of the webserver, it's parts and how it works is
described. Subsequently, selected interesting parts of the system is covered.
The order of this chapter mirrors the order in which the features were
developed.
