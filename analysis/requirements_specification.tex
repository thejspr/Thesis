\section{Requirements Specification}
In order to have a clear goal of what the software produced in this project
should do, a set of requirements are essential. The following lists the
requirements for the software developed in this project.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Parse HTTP/1.1 requests in accordance with RFC 2616.
  \item Logging of requests and responses.
  \item Handle concurrent requests in a non-blocking manner.
  \item Serve static files and directory listings.
  \item Serve dynamic content by executing Ruby scripts and returning the
  output.
  \item Implement the Rack interface and check for a Rack application in the
  current directory.
\end{itemize}

As this project was developed using BDD, the requirements specification was
translated into a set of acceptance tests to get concrete feedback on
completed requirements. The acceptance tests are included as
Appendix~\ref{acceptance_tests}.
