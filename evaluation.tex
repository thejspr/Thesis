This chapters looks critically at the final product and reflects upon the
project process.

\section{Product Evaluation}
The final version of Yarn (0.1.0) includes all features from the requirement
specification, and all acceptance tests and specifications passes. 

Yarn is stable with \textgreater 10 worker processes and at low request
volumes. However, when the requests to worker process ratio becomes too high,
some TCP connections are dropped and no content is delivered to the client.
It was not possible to fix this bug as no more time was left for
development.

\section{Process Reflection}
Developing software tests first proved to be difficult at times when it was
hard to figure out how a piece of code would even work. Having done mostly
non-test-first development prior to this project, it required a continous
concious effort to stick to writing tests before implementing features. Late
in the development phase, it became a more natural effort to drive the
implementation thorugh testing, and the advantages of the workflow were proved
a great asset. Having the tests provided the courage which was sometimes
needed prior to a large rewrite of refactoring of a feature, as it was always
easy to see whether the changes had broken the system. Furthermore, by writing
the tests first, it was always clear what the next step was as running the
test would reveal exactly what was missing in the implementation.

Given there was no design phase prior to starting the development, the design
desicions were made continously throughout the development. This resulted in
some desicions made early on which later proved to be less fortunate. But due
to the agile nature of BDD, and the confidence achieved by having a big test
suite, drastic design changes late in the process were possible. Had the
system been thoroughly designed upfront, such drastic changes might have been
fatal to the success of the project.
