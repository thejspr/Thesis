%ruby in general
Ruby is an dynamic, reflective object-oriented general-purpose programming language. It is dynamic in the sense that it is interpreted at runtime, and reflective in the sense that it can modify and inspect program behavior during runtime. 
Ruby has a dynamic type system where the type of the object is determined by what the object can do in terms of which methods are available for the object. 
This type system is referred to as duck typing, i.e.\ if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then the interpreter will treat it like a duck.

%interpreters
Ruby code is run in a virtual machine (VM) of which there exists several distributions. 
The official Ruby VM, for Ruby 1.9, is called YARV (Yet Another Ruby Virtual machine).
Other noteworthy Ruby VM's are Rubinius, JRuby and Ruby Enterprise Edition (REE).
